##  Overview

- Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.
- Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.
- Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. 

I am using 20 random locations because I couldn't find a dataset I was particularly looking for.

## Map

```{r}
# Loading the required packages

library(leaflet)
```

Creating a data frame containg the Latitude and Longitude of the 20 locations and plotting them on the map using leaflet.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)

df <- data.frame(lat= runif(20, min = 40, max = 70), long=runif(20, min = 40, max = 140))

# A view at the contents of the data frame
str(df)
head(df)
```

## Plotting in Map

```{r}
df %>% leaflet( width = 1000) %>% addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
```
