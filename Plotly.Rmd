## Overview

Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. 

I am using the pre-installed 'mtcars' dataset to create a 3-D Scatter plot and a Bar plot using Plotly.

## 3-D Scatter Plot

```{r}
# Loading the required packages and dataset

library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
data("mtcars")

plot_ly(x = mtcars$wt, y = mtcars$mpg, z = mtcars$hp, type="scatter3d", mode = "markers", color = mtcars$wt)
```

## Bar plot

```{r}
plot_ly(x = mtcars$mpg, y = mtcars$hp, type="bar") %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Miles per gallon"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Horsepower"))
```
